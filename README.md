<h1> Project Description: </h1>
<p1>We will combine the weather API and the Spotify API in order to make an application that allows the user to receive a playlist from Spotify to match the weather. 
  We expect to use the weather API, and the Spotify API. 
  We will use the database to store user account information.
  We intend to use React.js and Flask, but that may change.
